### 🚀 **How TugueGo Works**

TugueGo connects commuters and drivers in real-time through a **live map-based radar system**.
Here's how it works:

- **Commuters** appear as colored dots:
    - 🟢 **Green Dot** – Actively waiting for a ride.
    - 🔴 **Red Dot** – Not currently needing a ride.

- **Drivers** show up as icons based on their vehicle type:
    - 🚖 **Taxi** – Represented by a cute taxi icon.
    - 🏍️ **Motorcycle** – Represented by a motorcycle icon.
    - 🛺 **Tricycle** – Represented by a tricycle icon.
    - 🐎 **Kalesa (Coachman)** – Represented by a horse-drawn carriage icon.

When a commuter requests a ride, the system automatically connects them with the nearest available
driver. Both the commuter and driver can track the ride in real-time, ensuring a smooth journey!
